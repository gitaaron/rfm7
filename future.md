# Futur 

  * make 'graph generation' more dynamic (jupiter notebook?)

    * tooling

    * decouple 'log parsing' from 'graph generation scripts'

      * run log parser and output results into new time sequence DB


  * ec2 instances are idling for 60 sec.

    * remove idle and perform many more experiments with a smaller file size (to offset bandwidth charges)
