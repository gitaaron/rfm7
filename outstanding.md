# Outstanding Features

  * 'last 7 days'
    * "which will output a histogram with the time invested to perform a lookup in the DHT by the different probes"

  * factors
    * effects of file size

    * popularity

    * uptime of the requesting peers being live in the network

  * stability of measurements over time (ie/ is a node consistently involved in slow lookups?)

  * additionally, we could show the distribution of lookups in a specific probe, i.e. in a specific section of the network, in order to have a sense of the DHT lookup times to be expected for someone in the probe's premises.
