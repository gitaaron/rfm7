# Discussion

* review of results

* when publishing the same CID to several different regions

  * effects of proximity of content retrieval

    * is it usually fetched from the closest or is it random

    * mainly want to know wether content is being fetched from closest region geographically or not

    * should answer questions:

      * how often is the 'closest' (geographically and by network latency) not fetched?

      * how would fetching from the closest impact latency?

* what are all of the config options?
