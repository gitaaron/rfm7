# Kickoff

Date: Aug. 19, 2022

## Agenda

* demo what has been done

* questions

* go over 'next steps'

  * what needs to be done to get my application approved?


## Discussion

  * how frequently should reports be generated

    * if the probes are running all the time then daily otherwise weekly should be fine

    * conclusion: it is probably not necessary to diverge from current architecture

  * certain reports should be rendered server side so that they can easily be included [elsewhere](https://stats.ipfs.network/nebula-22-08-15/)

    * team prefers python over Javascript but language does not really matter

  * focus on getting E2E solution working locally to produce figure 9 in 'design and evaluation of IPFS' paper
