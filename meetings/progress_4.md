# Discussion

* geographic proximity

  * I can assume that the 'first provider' is also the primary 'content provider'

  * focus on question 'is closest copy served?'

* file size
  * see if  there is inconsistency between file size and any retrieval latency graphs
  * expect: other steps besides 'fetching' should stay constant and 'fetching' should increase linearly

* how long ago a file was published

  * for each phase a trend with a breakdown of 'publish age'

* how long a publisher has joined the network

* make sure to check out final reports in network measurements repo
